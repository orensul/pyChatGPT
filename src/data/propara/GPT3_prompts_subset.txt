Inputs:
PARAGRAPH:
The plasma membrane encloses the animal cell.
It controls the movement of materials into and out of the cell.
The Nucleus controls the activities of the cell.
These cellular activities require energy.
The Mitochondria extract energy from food molecules to provide the energy needs of the cell.
Animal cells must also synthesize a variety of proteins and other organic molecules necessary for growth and repair.
Ribosomes produce these proteins.
The cell may use these proteins or move them out of the cell for use in other cells.
To move organic molecules, the cell contains a complex system of membranes that create channels within the cell.
This system of membranes is called the endoplasmic reticulum.

The sugars can be used by the plant to make cellulose.
SUBJECT: What happens during photosynthesis?
Outputs:
TARGET_PARAGRAPH:
Photovoltaic cells, made of semi-conductive material, capture photons from sunlight and release electrons that flow as a direct current. 
This direct current is then converted into usable alternating current by an inverter.
This alternating current can be fed into the electrical grid or stored for later use.
SUBJECT: How does a solar panel works?
MAPPINGS:
light : sunlight

PARAGRAPH:
A female fish lays eggs.
Larvae hatch from the eggs.
The larvae eat and grow.
The larvae form into juvenile fish.
The juvenile fish grow into adult fish.
The adult fish mate.
The female fish lays eggs.
SUBJECT: Describe the life cycle of a fish
Outputs:
TARGET_PARAGRAPH:
A female plant produces seeds.
The seeds germinate, grow into sprouts, absorb nutrients 
from the soil and develop into young plants.
As the young plants grow, they develop leaves, 
stems, and roots and the process of photosynthesis starts.
The young plants continue to grow and develop, building a strong 
root system and producing more leaves, eventually becoming adult plants.
These adult plants are capable of reproducing by producing flowers, 
pollination and producing more seeds.
SUBJECT: Describe the life cycle of a plant
MAPPINGS:
female fish : female plant
eggs : seeds
larvae : sprouts
juvenile fish : young plants
adult fish : adult plants

PARAGRAPH:
There is a lot of rain or a dam breaks.
Water levels of a river or lake get higher.
Water builds up on the ground.
Water covers streets.
Water gets deep in some places.
Water goes into houses and other buildings.
The rain stops or the dam is repaired by an engineer.
Water flows into streams.
The rest of the floodwater evaporates.
SUBJECT: How do floods happen?
Outputs:
TARGET_PARAGRAPH:
A forest fire starts when there is an abundance of dry vegetation and an ignition source, such as lightning or an unattended campfire.
The fire spreads quickly, consuming the vegetation and creating large amounts of smoke.
The heat of the fire causes the air to become dry, further adding to the fire's spread.
As the fire continues, it goes deeper into the forest, 
consuming more and more vegetation until the fire is 
eventually put out with the help of firefighters or rain.
The aftermath of the fire is a charred landscape with hot spots still remaining.
The burned land eventually regrows, thanks to the ash that is a natural fertilizer and the retained moisture from the rain.
SUBJECT: 
MAPPINGS:
rain / dam breaks : lightning or an unattended campfire
water : fire
streets : vegetation
houses and bulidings: forest
