693,Describe the process of pollution causing bad effects on the enviroinment.,"One type of air pollution is the addition of carbon dioxide gas into the air.
Some scientists believe that releasing too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is one of the causes of global warming.
This upsets the balance of the carbon cycle.
The ozone layer helps protect us from harmful rays from the sun.
It is getting damaged from air pollution such as methane gas from livestock and CFCs from spray cans.
Acid rain is created when gasses such as sulfur dioxide get high into the atmosphere.
The wind can blow these gasses for miles and then they get washed out of the air when it rains.
This rain is called acid rain and can damage forests and kill fish.",Describe the process of oil spills causing bad effects on the environment.,"Oil spills can occur when a tanker ship carrying oil sinks or runs aground.
The oil can spread over a large area, damaging the ocean's ecosystem.
The oil coats the surface of the ocean and can be toxic to the animals living in the water, such as fish and other sea life.
The oil can also coat the feathers of seabirds, preventing them from flying or keeping them from being able to preen, which is necessary for their survival.
The oil can also wash up on shore and cause destruction to coastal ecosystems and damage to the shoreline.","Carbon dioxide : oil

Water evaporates.
Water vapor joins the atmosphere.
Carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane are greenhouse gases.",How does deforestation contribute to greenhouse gases?,"Deforestation increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Trees take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen.
When trees are cut down, less oxygen is released, and more carbon dioxide is released.
Fossil fuels are burned releasing carbon dioxide and other pollutants.
Cattle and other animals produce methane.
Methane can come from landfills or from the burning of organic waste.","People, engines, living things : deforestation

1148,How does a solar panel work?,"Solar panels actually comprise many, smaller units called photovoltaic cells.
Photovoltaic simply means they convert sunlight into electricity.).
Many cells linked together make up a solar panel.
Each photovoltaic cell is basically a sandwich made up of two slices of semi-conducting material, usually silicon : .
Manufacturers ""dope"" silicon with other materials, giving each slice of the sandwich a positive or negative electrical charge.
This adds extra electrons, with a negative charge, to that layer.
Meanwhile, the bottom layer gets a dose of boron, which results in fewer electrons, or a positive charge.
This all adds up to an electric field at the junction between the silicon layers.
When a photon of sunlight knocks an electron free, the electric field will push that electron out of the silicon junction.
A couple of other components of the cell turn these electrons into usable power.",How does a nuclear reactor work?,"A nuclear reactor consists of a core, which is usually composed of nuclear fuel rods and control rods.
The core is surrounded by a moderator, which is a material that slows down the nuclear reaction.
The moderator is surrounded by a coolant system that circulates a liquid or gas to absorb heat created by the reaction.
The coolant system circulates the fluid through a heat exchanger, which transfers the heat to a secondary system, such as a generator.
The generator then creates electricity from the heat.","Photovoltaic cells : nuclear fuel rods and control rods

908,How does weathering cause rocks to break apart?,"When water freezes it becomes 10% bigger, or takes up 10% more space.
As water expands it puts great pressure on the walls of anything containing it, including any rocks which happen to be surrounding it.
The force of the pressure exerted on the rock surrounding it is enough to wedge the walls of the crack farther apart, thus expanding and deepening the crack.
Clay expends when wet like ice does.
