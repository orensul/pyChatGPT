Your auditory nerve carries the message to your brain.
The brain translates the message so you can understand.",Audiology,How does the human visual system work?,Neurobiology and Cognitive Science
413,How does the human auditory system work?,"Something makes a sound and makes sound waves.
Sound waves are ""collected"" by the the outer ear.
Sound waves travel through the middle ear.
Sound waves hit the eardrum.
Vibrations from the eardrum cause very small bones in the inner ear to move.
The small bones in the inner ear give information about sound to the cochlea.
The cochlea helps turn the sound vibrations into nerve signals.
The brain can take these nerve signals and can register a sound to you because of them.",Auditory Neuroscience,How does the human visual system work?,Vision Science
416,How does a broken bone get treated and healed?,"A blood clot forms in the break.
