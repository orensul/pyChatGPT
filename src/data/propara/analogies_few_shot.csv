How does an animal cell works?,"The plasma membrane encloses the animal cell.
It controls the movement of materials into and out of the cell.
The Nucleus controls the activities of the cell.
These cellular activities require energy.
The Mitochondria extract energy from food molecules to provide the energy needs of the cell.
Animal cells must also synthesize a variety of proteins and other organic molecules necessary for growth and repair.
Ribosomes produce these proteins.
The cell may use these proteins or move them out of the cell for use in other cells.
To move organic molecules, the cell contains a complex system of membranes that create channels within the cell.
This system of membranes is called the endoplasmic reticulum.",How does a factory works?,"Security guards monitor the doors of the factory.
They control the movement of people into and out of the factory.
Factory activities may be coordinated by a control center.
These activities require energy.
The electrical generators in the factory provide energy.
The factory synthesizes products from raw materials using machines.
The factory has hallways to move products through it.","plasma membrane : security guards
animal cell : the factory
nucleus : control center
mitochondria : electrical generators
proteins : products
ribosomes : machines
endoplasmic reticulum : hallways"
How does the electrical circuit works?,"The battery generates electrical voltage.
The electrical voltage causes electrons to move through the copper wire.
The electrons pass through the resistor.
The resistor decrease the voltage in the circuit.",How does a water pump works?,"The pump creates pressure.
The pressure causes the water to flow through the pipe.
Flowing water through the water pump is controlled by a partially closing valve.
This partially closing valve reduces the flow rate of water in the pipe.","battery : pump
copper wire : pipe
electrons : water
resistor : partially closing valve"
What happens during photosynthesis?,"Carbon dioxide enters the leaf through the stomates.
Water is absorbed by the plant and transported to the leaves.
Sunlight is captured by the plant.
Energy in the form of ATP is made from the sun's energy.
Carbon dioxide, water, and ATP form sugars via the Calvin cycle.
Oxygen is given off as a byproduct.
Oxygen leaves the leaf through the stomates.
Water is reused or Water leaves the leaf.
The sugars can be used by the plant to make cellulose.",How does a solar panel works?,"Photovoltaic cells, made of semi-conductive material, capture photons from sunlight and release electrons that flow as a direct current. 
This direct current is then converted into usable alternating current by an inverter.
This alternating current can be fed into the electrical grid or stored for later use.","light : sunlight
leaves in the plants : photovoltaic cells
chemical energy : electrical energy.
Calvin cycle : inverter 
sugars : alternating current "
Describe the life cycle of a fish,"A female fish lays eggs.
Larvae hatch from the eggs.
The larvae eat and grow.
The larvae form into juvenile fish.
The juvenile fish grow into adult fish.
The adult fish mate.
The female fish lays eggs.",Describe the life cycle of a plant,"A female plant produces seeds.
The seeds germinate, grow into sprouts, absorb nutrients 
from the soil and develop into young plants.
As the young plants grow, they develop leaves, 
stems, and roots and the process of photosynthesis starts.
The young plants continue to grow and develop, building a strong 
root system and producing more leaves, eventually becoming adult plants.
These adult plants are capable of reproducing by producing flowers, 
pollination and producing more seeds.","female fish : female plant
eggs : seeds
larvae : sprouts
juvenile fish : young plants
adult fish : adult plants",
How do floods happen?,"There is a lot of rain or a dam breaks.
Water levels of a river or lake get higher.
Water builds up on the ground.
Water covers streets.
Water gets deep in some places.
Water goes into houses and other buildings.
The rain stops or the dam is repaired by an engineer.
Water flows into streams.
The rest of the floodwater evaporates.",How does fire happen I the forest?,"A forest fire starts when there is an abundance of dry vegetation and an ignition source, such as lightning or an unattended campfire.
The fire spreads quickly, consuming the vegetation and creating large amounts of smoke.
The heat of the fire causes the air to become dry, further adding to the fire's spread.
As the fire continues, it goes deeper into the forest, 
consuming more and more vegetation until the fire is 
eventually put out with the help of firefighters or rain.
The aftermath of the fire is a charred landscape with hot spots still remaining.
The burned land eventually regrows, thanks to the ash that is a natural fertilizer and the retained moisture from the rain.","rain / dam : lightning / unattended campfire
water : fire
streets : vegetation
houses and bulidings: forest
engineer : firefighter"
What happens during respiration?,"A person takes in oxygen through their nose or mouth.
The oxygen travels into the body.
Breaks down into glucose.
Carbon dioxide is produced by the glucose breakdown.
The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body through the nose or mouth.",What happens during combustion?,"A car takes in gasoline through the fuel cap.
The gasoline is pumped into the engine.
The gasoline is broken down into combustible gases.
The combustible gases are ignited by spark plugs.
The combustion creates energy and exhaust.
The exhaust is expelled from the car through the tailpipe. ","oxygen : gasoline
glucose : combustible gases
carbon dioxide : exhaust"
How does a steam engine work?,"Coal is heated in the boiler.
The water tank over the boiler is heated.
Creates steam.
The steam is funneled to the piston.
Piston uses the steam as energy.
The piston causes the crankshaft to move.",How does a waterwheel work?,"The water flows into the wheel, causing it to turn. 
As the wheel turns, it drives a mechanical system, 
such as a millstone or a generator, which performs work. 
The flow of water provides the energy to keep the wheel turning, 
allowing it to perform work over an extended period of time. ","steam : water 
piston : wheel
crankshaft : mechanical system (millstone or generator) "
How does the human auditory system work?,"Sound enters the ears of a person.
The sound hits a drum that is inside the ear.
The drum inside the ear converts the sound to electrical impulses.
The electrical impulses are sent to the brain.
The brain can decode the impulses into sound.",How does the telephone system work? ,"A person speaks into a telephone, the sound waves are transformed into an electrical current by the microphone. 
This electrical current is sent over the telephone line to the recipient's telephone. 
At the recipient's telephone, the electrical current is converted back into sound waves by the speaker. 
The recipient can then hear the message that was sent from the first person.","Sound source : person speaking
Ear drum : microphone
Electrical impulses : electrical current
Brain : recipient's telephone speaker"
How do kidneys filter blood?,"The kidneys receive blood from the renal artery.
They process it with millions of tiny nephrons.
Remove all the waste.
The kidneys return the blood back to the body through the renal artery.
Send the urine with the waste to the bladder through the ureters.",How do a waste treatment filter sewage?,"Waste treatment facility receives sewage through incoming pipes.
The facility processes the sewage using techniques like filtration and treatment to purify it before returning it to the environment.
The residual solid waste is then conveyed away from the processing site through conveyor belts and taken to a landfill for disposal. ","Nephrons : waste treatment methods
Renal artery : incoming pipes
Ureters : conveyor belts
Bladder : landfill"
How do you use a dishwasher?,"Open the Dishwasher.
Slide out the bottom rack.
Take a dirty plate.
Rinse the plate.
Place the dish in the rack.
Repeat leaving enough space for water to reach all items.
