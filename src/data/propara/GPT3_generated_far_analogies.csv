159,Describe the process of recycling an aluminum can,"Aluminium cans are put into a recycling bin.
Aluminium cans are then collected and taken to a treatment plant.
At the treatment plant the aluminium is sorted and cleaned.
Readied for reprocessing.
The aluminum cans go through a re-melt process.
Turned into molten aluminium.
The molten aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots.
The ingots are sent to mills and are rolled out into thin sheets.
The rolls are ready to be made into new aluminum products.",How does a chemical reaction work?,Chemistry,"Chemicals are put into a reaction vessel.
The chemicals are then mixed and heated to create a reaction.
The reaction is allowed to take place in the vessel, producing the desired product.
The product is then filtered and separated from the reaction byproducts.
The product is then purified and ready for use.","Aluminium cans : Chemicals
Treatment plant : Reaction vessel
Re-melt process : Mixing and heating
Ingots : Product
Mills : Filtering and separation"
165,How does the stomach work?,"Food leaves the esophagus and enters the stomach.
The stomach churns the food.
With the aid of stomach acids.
The food becomes a thick liquid.
Is then passed to the small intestine.",How does a circuit board work?,Electrical Engineering,"An electrical current enters a circuit board.
The circuit board routes the current through various components.
Using transistors, resistors and capacitors, the current is filtered, amplified, and shaped.
The shaped current exits the board, ready to be used in an application.","Food : electrical current
Esophagus : circuit board
Stomach : transistors, resistors, capacitors
Acids : filtering, amplifying, and shaping
Small intestine : application"

Is then passed to the small intestine.",How does a conveyor belt system work?,Mechanical Engineering,"Material enters the hopper, situated at the top of a conveyor belt.
The conveyor belt transports the material to the mixer.
The mixer churns the material with paddles, breaking it down into smaller pieces.
The pieces are then moved along the conveyor belt, where they are further broken down into a finer consistency.
The material is then ready for processing.","Food : Material
Esophagus : Hopper
Stomach : Mixer
Stomach acids : Paddles
Small intestine : Conveyor belt"

The stomach churns the food.
With the aid of stomach acids.
The food becomes a thick liquid.
Is then passed to the small intestine.",How does a chemical reactor work?,Chemical Engineering,"A chemical reaction takes place in a reactor.
The reactants are mixed together in the reactor.
Catalysts are added to the reactor to increase the rate of the reaction.
The reactants are broken down into simpler molecules or products.
The products are then removed from the reactor.","Esophagus : Reactants
Stomach : Reactor
Stomach acid : Catalysts
Thick liquid : Products
Small intestine : Removed from the reactor"

The stomach churns the food.
With the aid of stomach acids.
The food becomes a thick liquid.
Is then passed to the small intestine.",How does a prism work?,Physics,"Light enters a prism and is refracted.
The refracted light is then reflected off the inner walls of the prism.
The reflected light is bent further, resulting in a spectrum of colors.
The spectrum of colors is then projected outside the prism.","Esophagus : Light
Stomach : Prism
Acids : Refraction
Thick liquid : Reflection 
Small intestine : Spectrum of colors"

The stomach churns the food.
With the aid of stomach acids.
The food becomes a thick liquid.
Is then passed to the small intestine.",How does the respiratory system work?,Biology,"Oxygen enters the lungs and is absorbed into the bloodstream.
The blood travels through the body, carrying the oxygen to the cells.
The cells use the oxygen for energy and release carbon dioxide as a byproduct.
The carbon dioxide is then transported back to the lungs and is exhaled.","Food : oxygen
Esophagus : lungs
Stomach : bloodstream
Stomach acids : cells
Small intestine : exhaled air"

The substances are broken down into smaller molecules.
The molecules are then recombined with the aid of catalysts.
The catalysts decrease the activation energy required for the reaction to occur.
The reaction results in a new substance.","Food : Substances
Stomach : Reaction
Acids : Catalysts
Thick liquid : New Substance"
