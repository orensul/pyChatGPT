Mr Gerson had several pets but Mr Gerson valued the canary above all the rest.
Occasionally, Mr Gerson invited friends over to hear the canary sing.
However, one autumn the canary became very ill and there were no more of the canary beautiful songs.
Everyone was extremely disappointed.
A veterinarian friend had liked the canary's songs so much that A veterinarian friend decided A veterinarian friend would buy the canary and put the canary in A veterinarian friend office where A veterinarian friend could look after the canary.
A veterinarian friend paid Mr Gerson very well.
Upon being moved, the canary sang beautiful songs again
