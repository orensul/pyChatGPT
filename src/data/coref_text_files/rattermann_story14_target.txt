Zebediah, the old miser, was sitting on Zebediah back porch counting Zebediah money.
Suddenly, a beggar came out of the forsythia bushes.
Zebediah was very frightened so Zebediah started The yelling for the beggar to go away.
The yelling only caught the beggar's attention and a beggar began walking towards the old man.
The miser wished Zebediah had left the beggar alone.
To escape, Zebediah threw a bag of coins to the beggar.
While the beggar was occupied, Zebediah took the last few bags of money into the house and locked the door.
Zebediah figured that Zebediah was safe inside and Zebediah dozed off in an easy chair.
When Zebediah awoke Zebediah was surprised to discover another bag of coins was missing.
Zebediah could not find another bag of coins anywhere!
