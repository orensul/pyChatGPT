The environment in which rocks are located interacts with particles in the environment.
Particles in the environment take off small pieces of rock each time the particles come into contact with the rock.
If the particles keep striking, brushing, or growing against the rocks, small pieces will be detached.
It is at this point that the rock is pull apart by the impact.
As a result, there are now pieces of smaller rocks.
It has been found that the rock pieces are eroded into smaller and smaller pieces by the same forces.
