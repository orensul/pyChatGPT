A general was trying to destroy a fortress which was situated at the center of a country with roads leading to the fortress by using A general army.
A general needed to use A general army as a complete group in order to destroy the fortress.
However, A general could not march A general army down a road to the fortress because the roads were mined to explode when large groups of men passed over the roads.
After considerable thought, A general knew just what to do.
A general divided A general army up into small groups of men, and by sending these groups, simultaneously, from a number of different directions, these groups, converged on the fortress, making up a sufficiently powerful army to destroy the fortress
