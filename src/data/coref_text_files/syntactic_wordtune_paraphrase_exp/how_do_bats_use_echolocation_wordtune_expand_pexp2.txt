A group of bats fly through an area.
Bats make sounds by using Bats mouths or noses to do sounds.
As the sound waves travel away from the bat, the sound waves are absorbed by the earth.
Sound waves strike objects as Sound waves travel through the air.
In order for the sound waves to reach the bat, Sound waves need to rebound the objects.
As the sound waves reflect off of the objects, the bat hears Sound waves reverberating back to the bat,.
The bat is able to determine where the objects are because the bat, is able to hear the sound reverberates from where objects are located.
As the bat beats the objects, the bat, does not cause any injury to the bat,.
