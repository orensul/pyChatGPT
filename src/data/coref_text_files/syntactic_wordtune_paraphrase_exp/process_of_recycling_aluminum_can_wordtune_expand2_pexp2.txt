Aluminum cans and other products are placed into recycling bins so that Aluminum cans and other products might be recycled.
The municipality of your town or a private company will be responsible for gathering and shifting the aluminum to a recycling facility.
It is at the central recycling facility that the aluminum is ordered and cleaned.
the aluminum is melted down in order to abolish coatings and inks from the aluminum.
When aluminum is thawed, aluminum is formed into big formations called ingots.
Upon reaching at another facility, the ingots are rolled out so that the ingots are easier to handle.
It is now possible to produce new aluminum products from the ingots.
