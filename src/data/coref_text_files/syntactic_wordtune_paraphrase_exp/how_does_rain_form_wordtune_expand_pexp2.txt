A large amount of water evaporates from the ground upwards into the sky.
When the water is evaporating from the ground, the water forms droplets in the clouds.
The droplets combine to form bigger drops and then the clouds are filled with bigger drops.
As the drops get larger, bigger drops become heavier.
bigger drops fall toward the ground due to gravity
