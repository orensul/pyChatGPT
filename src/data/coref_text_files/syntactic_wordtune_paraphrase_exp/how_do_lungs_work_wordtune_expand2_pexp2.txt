When you breathe in, you are taking in air.
Through your bronchial tubes, air enter your lungs.
After the air has passed through the bronchial tubes, the air is divided into the bronchioles of each lung.
Alveoli, which are tiny sacs of air, are situated in the bronchioles.
The alveoli are surrounded by a big number of small blood vessels.
It is through these blood vessels that oxygen moves into the alveoli.
In the course of the blood journey through the body, the blood passes through the lungs.
When blood returns to the lungs, blood takes carbon dioxide along with blood.
It is this carbon dioxide that is released when you breathe out.
