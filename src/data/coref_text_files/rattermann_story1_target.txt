Karen always did poorly in high school so Karen despised high school.
But Karen loved vacations.
Karen spent most of Karen time dreaming about going to Hawaii.
Not long before the end of Karen fourth year Karen was not doing at all well in Karen classes because Karen had spent all Karen time daydreaming.
To motivate Karen Karen's father promised Karen that if Karen did well enough during the next few weeks to graduate from high school Karen's father would pay for Karen trip to Hawaii.
This made Karen extremely happy.
But Karen was too far behind in Karen classes.
Consequently Karen failed too many and did not go to Hawaii.
