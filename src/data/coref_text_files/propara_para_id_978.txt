Coal is burned.
Sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides.
The sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere.
The sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide.
The sulfur trioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, a very strong acid.
The sulfuric acid makes the rain acidic.
