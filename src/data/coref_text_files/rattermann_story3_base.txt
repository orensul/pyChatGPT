Joseph was a millionaire who hired a chauffeur to drive Joseph Rolls-Royce.
Joseph used to brag to Joseph wife that Joseph would never be late for Joseph conferences since Joseph had hired a chauffeur.
One morning when Joseph was in a great hurry, Joseph went to find the chauffeur.
But a chauffeur was asleep.
a chauffeur thought a chauffeur services would not be needed that day.
Thus Joseph was very late for Joseph conference after all.
To make sure this would not happen again, Joseph hired a second chauffeur.
