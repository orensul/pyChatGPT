An adult frog spawns eggs in water.
These eggs hatch into tadpoles and continue to live in the water.
The tadpoles grow developing external gills and a longer tail.
The tadpole begins storing food in the tail.
The tadpole develops hind legs and lives off food stored in the it's tail.
The front legs appear and the tadpole's tail shortens.
The tadpole now looks like a young frog.
The young frog continues to grow to adulthood.
