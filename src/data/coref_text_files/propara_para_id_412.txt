Sound waves enter your outer ear.
Travel through ear canal to your ear drum.
Eardrum vibrates with the incoming sound.
Send the vibrations to three tiny bones in your middle ear.
Bones in your middle ear amplify the vibrations.
Send the vibrations to your inner ear.
The vibrations activate tiny hair cells in your inner ear.
The hair cells release neurochemical messengers.
Your auditory nerve carries the message to your brain.
The brain translates the message so you can understand.
