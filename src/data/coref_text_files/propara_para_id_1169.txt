Prophase is the first and longest stage of mitosis In this stage the chromosomes become visible and the centrioles separate and move to opposite poles of the cell.
In Prophase the chromosomes become visible and the centrioles separate and move to opposite poles of the cell.
In metaphase the chromosomes line up across the center of the cell and become connected to the spindle fiber at the chromosomes centromere.
In anaphase the sister chromatids separate into individual chromosomes and are pulled apart.
During telophase the chromosomes gather at opposite ends of the cell and lose the chromosomes distinct rod-like shapes.
Two new nuclear membranes then form around each of the two regions of DNA and the spindle fibers disappear.
