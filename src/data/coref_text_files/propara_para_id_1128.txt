A hurricane usually starts as an organized thunderstorm activity that stretches at least 100 miles across and maintains it's identity for more than 24 hours.
Under the right conditions it's can develop further and start to spin around a low-pressure center.
If it's develops it's classified as a "tropical cyclone" or "tropical depression".
If the system strengthens and wind speeds rise past 39 mph, the system is dubbed a "tropical storm".
If the pressure in the center drops even further and the winds really pick up and forms a clearly defined "eye" it's a hurricane.
