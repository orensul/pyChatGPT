He air we breathe contains oxygen and other gases.
Once in the lungs, oxygen is moved into the bloodstream and carried through your body.
At each cell in your body, oxygen is exchanged for a waste gas called carbon dioxide.
Your bloodstream then carries this waste gas back to the lungs where this waste gas is removed from the blood stream and then exhaled.
Your lungs and respiratory system automatically perform this vital process, called gas exchange.
