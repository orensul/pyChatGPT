Air and fuel are used in the internal combustion engine.
In an enclosed chamber, a mixture of air and fuel is injected.
The mixture ignites and turns a piston that pumps up and down.
This piston is connected to a crankshaft which rotates to provide the power.
The burned gas is pushed out of the chamber.
