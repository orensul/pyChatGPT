Wind and water cause erosion and weathering to the rocks.
Eroded rock particles are carried away by wind or by rain, streams, rivers, and oceans.
Rock particles sink to the bottom of rivers and oceans creating a layer of sediment.
Layers of sediment stack up compacting the bottom layers.
Minerals fill in the gaps in the sediment eventuality becoming sedimentary rocks.
Rocks buried deep underground exposed to high heat and pressure become metamorphic rock.
Metamorphic rocks underground melt to become magma.
Magma flows from volcanoes in the form of lava.
lava cools and forms igneous rock.
Igneous rock begins being weathered and eroded by water and wind.
