A conducting metal, like copper, is wrapped around a piece of metal.
An electrical source, like a battery, produces an electrical current.
The electrical current flows through the wire.
The electrical current creates a magnetic field around the wire, magnetizing the metal.
The magnetic field can be turned on and off by starting or stopping the electricity source.
