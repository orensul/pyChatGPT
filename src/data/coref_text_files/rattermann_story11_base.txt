A farmer named Beedle had a choice apricot tree that Beedle valued above all the rest in Beedle garden.
Every year Beedle gave presents of fruit from this tree to everyone Beedle knew.
But one year the tree began to wither and there was no moreof the wonderful fruit.
Everyone was very unhappy.
The judge had enjoyed the apricots from the tree very much so much so that The judge resolved to take the tree to The judge own garden to take care of this tree.
The judge paid Beedle very well and had the tree moved to The judge own grounds.
Fortunately, as soon as this tree was transplanted, the tree bore delicious apricots again.
That very year, the fruit won first prize in the county fair
