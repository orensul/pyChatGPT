Muscles work by expanding and contracting.
A muscle fiber gets a signal from A muscle fiber nerve.
Proteins and chemicals release energy to either contract the muscle or relax the muscle.
When the muscles contracts the bones connected to he muscle are pulled closer together.
When the muscle relaxes the bones move farther apart.
