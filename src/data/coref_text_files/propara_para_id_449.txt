Rock begins as magma from a volcano.
The magma cools.
Crystals form and the magma become igneous rocks.
The igneous rocks break down into sediment.
Become sedimentary rocks.
If subjected to heat and/or pressure from plate-tectonic activity the sedimentary rocks become metamorphic rock.
The metamorphic rocks melt.
Become magma again.
