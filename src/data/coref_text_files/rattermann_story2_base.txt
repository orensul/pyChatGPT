Mr Newton was the manager of a company that made razors.
One year, an inventor in his company perfected a metal that would stay sharper than any previous razor.
However, not long after that, Mr Newton was using one of these new razors and Mr Newton cut Mr Newton neck rather severely.
As a result of this incident the inventor recommended a safety feature that would protect people from injuring people.
After what had happened, Mr Newton considered the safety feature absolutely necessary.
The incident had alarmed Mr Newton so much that Mr Newton began to produce the safety razor right away.
Luckily, Mr Newton neck did not get infected so everything was alright
