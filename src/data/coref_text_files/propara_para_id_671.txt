A liquid is heated from an external source.
The heat causes the molecules in the liquid to increase in energy.
As the molecules absorb more energy, the molecules start to move faster.
As the molecules are moving faster the molecules are increasing in temperature.
When the molecules reach a certain temperature, the boiling point, the molecules change from liquid to gas state.
As the liquid molecules go into a gaseous state, the molecules float out into the atmosphere.
When all the liquid has turned to gas, all the liquid has evaporated completely, leaving no liquid behind.
