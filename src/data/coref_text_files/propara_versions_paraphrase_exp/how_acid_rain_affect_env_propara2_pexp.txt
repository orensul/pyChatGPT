Fossil fuels are burned.	
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) are emitted into the atmosphere.	
The SO2 and NOX react with water, oxygen and other chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acids.	
These acids get into rain water in rain clouds.	Acid rain falls to earth.	
Acid rain weakens trees by washing away the protective film on leaves.	
Acid rain falls into lakes and causes the water to become acidic.	
The acidic water is harmful to wildlife that live in and drink the water.
