Chemical reactions in the battery causes a build up of electrons at the anode.
a build up of electrons at the anode results in an electrical difference between the anode and the cathode.
The electrons wants to rearrange The electrons to get rid of this difference.
The electrons go to the cathode.
Electricty is created.
