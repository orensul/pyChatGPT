Greenhouse gases are released into the air by human activities.
The earth changes energy from the sun into heat.
Heat rises from the ground.
Greenhouse gas molecules in the atmosphere prevent the heat from going into space.
The temperature of the earth increases.
The temperature continues to rise and melts the polar ice caps.
The temperature rises even faster.
