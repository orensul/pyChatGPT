Water from oceans, lakes, swamps, rivers, and plants turns into water vapor.
Water vapor condenses into millions of tiny droplets that form clouds.
Clouds lose these droplets through rain or snow, also caused precipitation.
Precipitation is either absorbed into the ground or runs off into rivers.
Water that was absorbed into the ground is taken up by plants.
Plants lose water from Plants surfaces as vapor.
The vapor goes back into the atmosphere.
Water that runs off into rivers flows into ponds, lakes, or oceans.
The water evaporates back into the atmosphere.
