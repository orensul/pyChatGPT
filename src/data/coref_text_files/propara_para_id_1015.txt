To bake a cake you first need to gather your ingredients.
Preheat the oven to desired baking temperature.
Grease your preferred cake pan with crisco or butter or other non-stick spray.
Add eggs and vegetable oil to the dry ingredients.
Stir or whisk until all the dry flour has been absorbed.
Pour the batter into the greased cake pan.
Place cake pan into the oven for the required time.
When a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, the cake is done baking.
