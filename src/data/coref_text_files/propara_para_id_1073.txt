There is a rain cloud in the sky.
Small bits of ice within the cloud bump each other.
The collisions create electrical charge.
Lighter, positively charged particles sink to the bottom of the cloud.
Heavier, negatively charges particles rise to the top.
When the positive and negative charges grow large enough, a giant spark, called lightning occurs.
