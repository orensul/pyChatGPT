A dam is built in an area prone to flooding.
A large amount of rain occurs.
The water builds up behind the dam.
The dam opens A dam floodgates when A dam starts to get full.
The water flows into a river below the dam.
The dam closes A dam gates.
The dam will occasionally open A dam gates again to gradually release more water.
Eventually all of the floodwater will be slowly released into the river without causing any flood damage.
