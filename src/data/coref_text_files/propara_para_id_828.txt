A fuel is heated in an oven.
Above the oven is a tank of water that is sealed.
The tank of water begins to boil above the oven.
A the water boils steam is created.
The steam is denser than air so steam needs a place to go.
The steam is forced out of the tank and into a piston.
The piston moves up.
The valve of the piston closes.
The valve on the next piston opens.
The steam fills the next piston, driving the next piston up, and the other one down.
