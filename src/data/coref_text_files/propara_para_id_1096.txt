A red giant burns mass.
This mass creates high core temperatures.
The mass decreases.
The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in the star center.
The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers.
The layers break away.
Only the inner core remains.
This inner core is known as a white dwarf.
