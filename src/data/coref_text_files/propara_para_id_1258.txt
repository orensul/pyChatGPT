Stars burn mass.
The star burns until The star runs out of fuel.
The star can no longer support The star weight.
The layers of hydrogen press down on the core.
The core gets smaller and smaller under the pressure.
The pressure causes gravity to get stronger.
The gravity becomes so powerful that nothing can escape gravity.
Anything that gets close to The star is drawn into The star by The star gravity.
Light is drawn into The star.
Light can not escape.
