Wire is wrapped around a piece of metal.
Current is sent through the wire.
A magnetic field is produced by the current.
This magnetic field in the wire interacts with certain particles in the central metal part.
The piece of metal becomes magnetized.
The magnetism remains until the current is shut off.
