Bees find a place for the hive, such as a rock crevice or tree branch.
Bees gather nectar from flowers.
The bees The evaporation the nectar by passing nectar back and forth to each other.
The evaporation turns the nectar into sugary honey.
The bees chew the honey until sugary honey turns into moldable wax.
The bees mold the wax into hexagonal (six sided) cylinders.
Thousands of these hexagonal cylinders put together form the hive.
