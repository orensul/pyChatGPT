A dog named Leonard was trotting along a dock holding a steak in Leonard teeth.
However, as Leonard trotted Leonard dropped a steak inadvertently and a steak disappeared into the lake.

Then Leonard saw another dog with a steak.
Because Leonard had lost Leonard own steak Leonard tried to take a steak.
Unluckily, the other dog was much bigger than Leonard was.
Leonard ended up losing a tooth in the scuffle
