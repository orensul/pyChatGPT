Nuclear plants use uranium-235, which is unstable.
Uranium-235 splits, releasing energy and neutrons.
The neutrons hit other atoms, splitting other atoms,.
This continues until the reaction is self-sustaining.
Rods containing uranium are used in the power plant.
Control rods slow or accelerate the reaction.
Heat from the fission turns water into steam.
The steam drives a turbine.
The turbine drives a generator.
The generator creates electricity.
