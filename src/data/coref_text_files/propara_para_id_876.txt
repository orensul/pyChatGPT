Water vapor gets into the atmosphere through a process called evaporation.
a process called evaporation then turns the water that is at the top of oceans, rivers and lakes into water vapor in the atmosphere using energy from the sun.
The water vapor rises in the atmosphere and there The water vapor cools down.
Water vapor rises in the atmosphere and there Water vapor cools down and forms tiny water droplets through something called condensation.
tiny water droplets then turn into clouds.
When they clouds combine together, clouds grow bigger and are too heavy to stay up there in the air.
This is when clouds will fall to the ground as rain, or maybe snow or hail by gravity.
