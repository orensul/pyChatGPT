A surgeon was trying to destroy a cancer which was situated in the central region of a patient's brain, by using a type of ray.
A surgeon needed to use these rays at a high intensity in order to destroy the cancerous tissue.
However, at such an intensity the healthy brain tissue will also be destroyed.
After considerable thought, A surgeon knew just what to do.
A surgeon divided the rays up into batches of low-intensity rays, and then by sending these rays simultaneously from a number of different directions, these rays converged on the cancer, making up a sufficiently high intensity to destroy the cancer,
