Electromagnet creates magnetic field with electricity.
Conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of metal.
An electric current gets introduced from power source.
Flows through the wire.
Magnetic field gets created in the wire.
And the metal gets magnetized.
When turned off the metal is no longer magnetic.
