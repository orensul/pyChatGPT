Environmental particles interchange with rocks in a number of ways.
Each time a particle touches the rock, little bits of rock are detached from the rock.
When a particle broom against, strike, or become bigger against the rocks, the particles abolish small pieces of the rock.
These impacts eventually cause the rocks to be broken apart by these impacts.
Eventually, the rock, becomes small rocks as a result of this wear and tear.
By the same force, the rock pieces are getting worn away into smaller and smaller fragments.
