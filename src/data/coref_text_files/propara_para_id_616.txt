Waste products are deposited in the blood.
Blood is carried to the kidneys through the renal arteries.
The kidneys contain filters inside.
The filters capture the waste products.
The waste is combined with water to make urine.
The urine leaves the kidney and is collected in the bladder.
The cleaned blood is returned to the body.
