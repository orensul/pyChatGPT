The butterfly starts as an egg.
The egg hatches to form a larva, also called a caterpillar.
The carterpillar molts (loses The carterpillar skin) many times as The carterpillar grows.
The caterpillar then forms The carterpillar into a pupa, or chrysalis.
The caterpillar in the chrysalis begins change, a process called mmetaphorphosis.
The caterpillar completes The carterpillar metamorphosis and has turned into a butterfly.
The adult butterfly emerges out of the chrysalis and flys away!.
