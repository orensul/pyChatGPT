Once there was a small country called Zerdia that learned to make the world's smartest computer.
One day Zerdia was the attack by Zerdia warlike neighbor, Gagrach.
But the missiles were badly aimed and the attack failed.
The Zerdian government realized that Gagrach wanted Zerdian computers so Gagrach offered to sell some of Gagrach computers to the country.
The government of Gagrach was very pleased.
Gagrach promised never to attack Zerdia again
