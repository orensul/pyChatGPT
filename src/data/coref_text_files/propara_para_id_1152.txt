The nuclei of some atoms have too few or too many neutrons.
The atoms become unstable.
The atoms split.
In alpha decay, two protons and two neutrons are released from the atom.
In beta decay, a neutron changes into a proton and an electron.
The proton joins the nucleus of the atom.
The electron is released.
