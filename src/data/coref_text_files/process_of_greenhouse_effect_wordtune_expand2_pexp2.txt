Atmospheres on Earth get solar radiation from the sun.
Some of solar radiation from the sun is reflected back into space as Some of it passes through the atmosphere.
Most of the remaining heat is soak up by the continents and oceans, which in turn heats the planet.

The temperature of the Earth increases as a result
