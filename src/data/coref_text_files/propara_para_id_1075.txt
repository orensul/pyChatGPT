Ice forms inside a cloud.
Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges.
The cloud becomes a thundercloud.
Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge.
Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud.
This positive energy gathers on the ground.
The positive energy connects with the negative energy and forms lightning.
