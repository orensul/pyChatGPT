Frederick the shepherd was tending Frederick flock at the edge of a forest.
Suddenly, a lion appeared out of the forest.
Frederick was really scared so Frederick started the shouting to scare the lion away.
But the shouting did nothing but attract the lion's attention and a lion began walking towards Frederick.
Frederick then realized Frederick should have left a lion alone.
To escape, Frederick gave the lion a lamb.
While the lion was occupied, Frederick led the rest of the flock away.

So Frederick took a nap on the grass.
However, when Frederick awoke Frederick notice another lamb was missing and Frederick could not find another lamb anywhere!.
At the next opportunity, Frederick bought a blunderbuss so Frederick could better defend Frederick flock in the future
