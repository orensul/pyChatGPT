Magma rises from deep in the earth.
The magma goes into volcanos.
The volcanos pressure the magma upwards.
The pressure causes the magma to push through the surface of the volcano.
The lava cools.
The lava forms new rock.
New magma is pressured to the surface of the volcano.
The volcano bursts through the rock the formed after the last eruption.
