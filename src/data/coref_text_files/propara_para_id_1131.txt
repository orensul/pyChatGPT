Bees go out during the day and gather food.
Then while gathering of their food, they make wax, which is the building block of their bee hive.
Bees make food called honey.
Bees use a sticky, glue-like substance called propolis as a binding to hold Bees hives together.
Bees produce all of the building blocks to build Bees hive in Bees own body.
