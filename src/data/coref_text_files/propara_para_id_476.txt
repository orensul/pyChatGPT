Human beings burn fossil fuels (oil, gas, etc.).
Carbon dioxide from the burning fossil fuels enter the atmosphere.
The make-up of the atmosphere changes.
Some energy from the sun cannot escape back through the changed atmosphere.
The earth begins to heat because of the extra trapped energy.
Human beings cut down trees.
Human beings do not re-plant the trees.
Trees cannot help take the extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
The extra trapped energy starts to change the earth's short term weather.
Eventually the long-term climate patterns start to change.
