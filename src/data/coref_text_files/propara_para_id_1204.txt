MRNA is made during the first step of protein synthesis, which is transcription.
The DNA's genetic information, or secret code, gets written onto a strand of mRNA.
Transcription takes place in the nucleus.
The next step in making a protein is called translation.
The mRNA attaches The mRNA to the ribosome Read more at: http://www.ducksters.com/science/biology/proteins_and_amino_acids.php This text is Copyright Ducksters Do not use without permission.
The ribosome figures out where to start on the mRNA by finding a special three letter "begin" sequence called a codon.
The ribosome then moves down the strand of mRNA.
When the ribosome sees the "stop" code, the ribosome ends the translation and the protein is complete.
