Peter was a young man from Iceland who moved to Florida one summer.
Peter was very self-conscious about Peter fair skin.
Peter thought that people would not accept Peter unless Peter tanned Peter golden-brown like every one else.
So Peter spent a whole day in the sun, trying to get a tan.
Peter didn't understand how dangerous the sun could be.
Consequently, by evening Peter had second degree burns over most of Peter body and Peter had to go to the hospital.
Peter decided that Florida was not for Peter and booked the next ocean liner back to Iceland.
Peter spent the whole trip under a large umbrella keeping cool
