Solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere.
Some is reflected back into space.
The rest of the energy is absorbed by land and oceans, heating the Earth.
Heat radiates from Earth's to space.
Some of this heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Human activities such as burning fuel are increasing the amount of greenhouses gases.
This causes more heat radiation to stay trapped in our atmosphere.
The Earth's temperature rises.
