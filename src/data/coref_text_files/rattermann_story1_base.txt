William was a patient in a psychiatric hospital who was confined indoors almost all the time.
William could never pass the monthly room inspections so William hated the monthly room inspections.
William spent most of William time daydreaming about food.
A few day before the April inspection William room was still a mess since William had done nothing but daydream.
To provide William with an incentive, the nurse promised William some gingerbread from the cookie shop if William scrubbed William room and put William's room in order once and for all.
William was overjoyed.
But there was no longer enough time for William to put William's room in order.
As a result, William did not pass the inspection and did not get any gingerbread.
William sulked all day and slammed William door so hard the plaster cracked, but William still didn't get any gingerbread
