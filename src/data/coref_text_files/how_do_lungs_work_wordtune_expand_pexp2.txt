In order to breathe, you have to inhale air.
The bronchial tubes enable air to pass into.
Each lung is then divided into bronchioles by the splitting of the air.
There is a tiny air sac called an alveolus in the bronchioles.
A big number of small blood vessels nearby the alveoli.
Through the alveoli, oxygen moves into the blood vessels.
During the process of traveling through the body, blood departs the lungs.
The blood carry carbon dioxide back to the lungs where carbon dioxide is exhaled.
As you breathe out, you discharge carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
