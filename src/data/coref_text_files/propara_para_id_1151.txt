A radioisotope has unstable nuclei that does not have enough binding energy to hold the nucleus together.
Radioisotopes would like to be stable isotopes so Radioisotopes are constantly changing to try and stabilize.
In the process, Radioisotopes will release energy and matter from Radioisotopes nucleus and often transform into a new element.
This process, called transmutation, is the change of one element into another as a result of changes within the nucleus.
He radioactive decay and transmutation process will continue until a new element is formed that has a stable nucleus and is not radioactive.
