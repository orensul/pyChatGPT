Karen always did poorly in high school so she despised it.
But she loved vacations.
She spent most of her time dreaming about going to Hawaii.
Not long before the end of her fourth year Karen was not doing at all well in her classes because she had spent all her time daydreaming.
To motivate her, Karen's father promised her that if she did well enough during the next few weeks to graduate from high school he would pay for her trip to Hawaii.
This made Karen extremely happy.
But she was too far behind in her classes.
Consequently she failed too many and did not go to Hawaii.
