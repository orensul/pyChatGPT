One type of air pollution is the addition of carbon dioxide gas into the air.
Some scientists believe that releasing too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is one of the causes of global warming.
This upsets the balance of the carbon cycle.
The ozone layer helps protect us from harmful rays from the sun.
It is getting damaged from air pollution such as methane gas from livestock and CFCs from spray cans.
Acid rain is created when gasses such as sulfur dioxide get high into the atmosphere.
The wind can blow these gasses for miles and then they get washed out of the air when it rains.
This rain is called acid rain and can damage forests and kill fish.
