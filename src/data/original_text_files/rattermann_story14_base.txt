Frederick the shepherd was tending his flock at the edge of a forest.
Suddenly, a lion appeared out of the forest.
Frederick was really scared so he started shouting to scare the lion away.
But the shouting did nothing but attract the lion's attention and it began walking towards him.
He then realized he should have left it alone.
To escape, Frederick gave the lion a lamb.
While the lion was occupied, he led the rest of the flock away.
Eventually, he guessed they were far enough away to be safe from the lion.
So he took a nap on the grass.
However, when he awoke he notice another lamb was missing and he could not find it anywhere!.
At the next opportunity, Frederick bought a blunderbuss so he could better defend his flock in the future.
