A type of coal must be chosen before the heating can start.
The coal is broken down to a smaller material.
The coal particles mix with hot air and move in to a boiler.
Water in the boiler is pumped and produces steam with the coal.
Steam powers turbine blades, which magnetically charge wire coals.
The water returns back in to its chamber and the process is repeated.
