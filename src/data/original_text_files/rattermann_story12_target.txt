A little girl named Jenny loved to play with her dog in her neighbor's yard.
Eventually, the neighbor got fed-up and told her she should always play with her dog in her own yard.
A few days later, Jenny snuck out of the house without doing her chores and hid at the playground.
But after awhile she went home to play with her dog because she thought her neighbor said she should every day.
Right away her mother caught her and the little girl wished she hadn't listened to her neighbor.
