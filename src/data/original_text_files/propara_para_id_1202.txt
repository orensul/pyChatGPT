Information encoded in DNA is copied to a RNA molecule.
The mRNA molecule is sent to the cytoplasm.
The mRNA bonds with ribosomes.
TMRNA molecules bind with the ribosome in a sequence defined by the mRNA code.
The ribosome slides down the mRNA.
The process continues until one of the stop codons enters the A site.
