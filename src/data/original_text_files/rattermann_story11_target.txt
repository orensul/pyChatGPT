Mr. Gerson had several pets but he valued the canary above all the rest.
Occasionally, he invited friends over to hear the canary sing.
However, one autumn the canary became very ill and there were no more of its beautiful songs.
Everyone was extremely disappointed.
A  veterinarian  friend  had liked the canary's songs  so much that he decided he would buy the canary and put it in his office where he could look after it.
He  paid  Mr. Gerson very well.
Upon being moved, the canary sang beautiful songs again.
