Aluminium cans are put into a recycling bin.
Aluminium cans are then collected and taken to a treatment plant.
At the treatment plant the aluminium is sorted and cleaned.
Readied for reprocessing.
The aluminum cans go through a re-melt process.
Turned into molten aluminium.
The molten aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots.
The ingots are sent to mills and are rolled out into thin sheets.
The rolls are ready to be made into new aluminum products.
