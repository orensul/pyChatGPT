The organism must die to begin the process.
The soft tissue decomposes.
The bones are left behind.
Scavengers tear the body apart and move the bones elsewhere.
Wind and rain also scatter the bones further.
The bones left behind will weather and become buried by sand and soil.
The proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil.
This creates a rock-like substance called a fossil.
Water and wind erosion wear away the layers of soil on top of the fossil.
This makes discovery of the fossil possible.
