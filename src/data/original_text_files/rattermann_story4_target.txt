Once there was a small country called Zerdia that learned to make the world's smartest computer.
One day Zerdia was attacked by its warlike neighbor, Gagrach.
But the missiles were badly aimed and the attack failed.
The Zerdian government realized that Gagrach wanted Zerdian computers so it offered to sell some of its computers to the country.
The government of Gagrach was very pleased.
It promised never to attack Zerdia again.
