Peter was a young man from Iceland who moved to Florida one summer.
He was very self-conscious about his fair skin.
Peter thought that people would not accept him unless he tanned himself golden-brown like every one else.
So Peter spent a whole day in the sun, trying to get a tan.
He didn't understand how dangerous the sun could be.
Consequently, by evening he had second degree burns over most of his body and he had to go to the hospital.
Peter decided that Florida was not for him and booked the next ocean liner back to Iceland.
He spent the whole trip under a large umbrella keeping cool.
