King Otto was a warmonger who was obsessed with conquest and riches.
One year he decided to rebuild all the bridges of the kingdom to make them strong enough for all his armies.
Otto's counselor, the chamberlain, complained that he was spending too much money on the.
bridges and not enough on actual military campaigns.
Because of all the construction too many of the bridges were out of commission being worked on.
Otto decided that the chamberlain was right and he abandoned the bridge project to mount a full-scale invasion of a neighboring country.
Then one day when King Otto was travelling through his kingdom his carriage crashed through an unfinished bridge.
He was severely injured but the mishap made it clear to him that he needed to balance his military and domestic expenditures.
Also, he ordered the chamberlain to get him a new crown because the old one had gotten smashed in the crash.
