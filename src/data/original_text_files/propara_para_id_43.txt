Oceans, lakes, and rivers contain water.
The sun heats up the water.
The water evaporates from the heat.
The water moves to the sky as steam or as invisible vapor.
The water forms clouds in the sky.
The clouds become larger as they are filled with more water.
The air is cooled.
Water forms droplets in the clouds.
The droplets fall to earth as rain.
