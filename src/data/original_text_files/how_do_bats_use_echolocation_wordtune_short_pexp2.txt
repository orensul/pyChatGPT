It's bats flying.
Bats do sounds with their mouths or noses.
A bat's sound travels away from it.
A sound wave beat an object.
It bounces off the objects back to the bat.
Echoing sound waves are heard by the bat.
Bats know where objects are by where the echo came from.
By beating objects, the bat does not hurt itself.
