You find an empty ice cube tray.
You fill the tray with warm water.
You carefully place the tray on an even surface in a freezer that is at least 32 degree Farhenheit, the freezing point of water.
The water begins to get colder until it starts to freeze solid.
The water expands as it freezes, one of the few liquids that has greater volume as a solid.
Because you used warm water, the gasses in the water had evaporated out, so you will have nice clear ice cubes without cracks from the trapped gasses.
