A dam is built in an area prone to flooding.
A large amount of rain occurs.
The water builds up behind the dam.
The dam opens its floodgates when it starts to get full.
The water flows into a river below the dam.
The dam closes its gates.
The dam will occasionally open its gates again to gradually release more water.
Eventually all of the floodwater will be slowly released into the river without causing any flood damage.
