Plants absorb water from the ground through their root systems.
Using sunlight, the plant separates the hydrogen and oxygen molecules through the process of photosynthesis.
The plant releases the oxygen into the atmosphere.
Combines the hydrogen with carbon dioxide to create an intermediate.
The intermediate is used to produce glucose which is the plant's food.
