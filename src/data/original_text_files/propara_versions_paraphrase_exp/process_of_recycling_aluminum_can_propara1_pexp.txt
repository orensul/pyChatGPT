The aluminium can is then collected and taken to a treatment plant.
The aluminum then goes through a re-melt process and turns into molten aluminium.
The re-melt process removes the coatings and inks that may be present on the aluminium.
The aluminium is then made into large blocks called ingots.
Each ingot contains about 1.6 million drinks cans.
