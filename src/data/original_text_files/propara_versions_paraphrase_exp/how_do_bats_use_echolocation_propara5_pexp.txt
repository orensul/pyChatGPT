Bats and other animals produce a high-pitched tone.
The sound travels in waves, as sound does.
The sound "bounces" off of a nearby object.
The sound wave returns to the bat.
The bat hears the echoed sound.
Folds in the bat's ear and adaptations in the bat's brain enable it to determine the size, shape, and position of the other object via the properties of the returned sound waves.
Other animals use echolocation in generally similar ways.
