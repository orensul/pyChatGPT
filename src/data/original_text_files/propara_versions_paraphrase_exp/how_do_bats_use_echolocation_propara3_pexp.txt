A bat makes high pitched sounds by moving air past their vibrating vocal chords.
The sound travels through the air as a wave, and the energy of this wave bounces off any object it comes across.
The bat carefully listens.
The bat hears echoes from the sounds bouncing off objects.
The bat uses that information to navigate and to locate prey in the dark.
The bat can tell how big an insect is and in what direction it is moving.
