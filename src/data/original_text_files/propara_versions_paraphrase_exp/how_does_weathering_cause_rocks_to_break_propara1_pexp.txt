Mechanical weathering is when rock breaks apart into smaller pieces.
Ice wedges into cracks in rock when water in the rocks freezes, causing breaks in the rocks.
Wetting and drying breaks up rocks that contain clay.
Wet clay expands, putting pressure on other rocks, causing them to break.
Plant roots break up rocks when they grow.
Animals dig into soil, helping water to reach down to the bedrock and cause it to weather.
Chemical weathering happens when water and another substance react.
