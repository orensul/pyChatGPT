Breathing air in.
Bronchial tubes get air.
Lungs split air into bronchioles.
Alveoli are tiny air sacs in the bronchioles.
Small vessels surround alveoli.
Alveoli carry oxygen to blood vessels.
As blood moves through the body, it leaves the lungs.
CO2 is carried by blood to the lungs.
CO2 is released when you exhale.
