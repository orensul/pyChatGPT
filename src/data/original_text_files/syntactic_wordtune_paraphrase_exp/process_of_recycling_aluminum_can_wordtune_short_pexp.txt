Aluminum cans and other products are recycled.
Recycling facilities or your town collect and transport aluminum.
At the central facility, the aluminum is sorted and cleaned.
The ink and coatings are removed.
It is then formed into ingots.
During transport, the ingots are rolled out for easier manipulation.
Now they can be turned into new aluminum products.
