Atmospheres on Earth receive solar radiation from the sun.
Some of it is reflected back into space as it passes through the atmosphere.
Most of the remaining heat is absorbed by the continents and oceans, which in turn heats the planet.
Heat is radiated from the Earth to the heavens.
A substantial quantity of this heat is trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases and other greenhouse gases.
Human activities such as burning fuels contribute to this increase in greenhouse gas emission.
The more greenhouse gases we have in our atmosphere, the more heat can be trapped there.
The temperature of the Earth rises as a result.
