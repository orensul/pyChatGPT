In order to breathe, you have to inhale air.
The bronchial tubes allow air to enter.
Each lung is then divided into bronchioles by the splitting of the air.
There is a tiny air sac called an alveolus in the bronchioles.
A large number of small blood vessels surround the alveoli.
Through the alveoli, oxygen passes into the blood vessels.
During the process of traveling through the body, blood leaves the lungs.
The blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs where it is exhaled.
As you exhale, you release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
