The environment in which rocks are located interacts with particles in the environment.
Particles in the environment remove small pieces of rock each time they come into contact with the rock.
If the particles keep hitting, brushing, or growing against the rocks, small pieces will be removed.
It is at this point that the rock is broken apart by the impact.
As a result, there are now pieces of smaller rocks.
It has been found that the rock pieces are worn away into smaller and smaller pieces by the same forces.
