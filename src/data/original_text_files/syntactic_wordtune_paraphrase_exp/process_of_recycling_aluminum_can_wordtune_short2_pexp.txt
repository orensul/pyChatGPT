Recycling aluminum cans and other products is easy.
The town or a private company collects and transports aluminum for recycling.
At the central recycling facility, aluminum is sorted and cleaned.
Coatings and inks are removed from aluminum.
Ingots are large formations made from melted aluminum.
They are rolled out in another facility to make them easier to handle.
Now, the ingots can be used for aluminum products.
