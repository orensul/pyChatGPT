In order to recycle aluminum cans and other products, you need to place them in recycling bins.
The city or a private company is responsible for collecting and transporting the aluminum to a recycling facility.
Once at the recycling facility, the aluminum will be sorted and cleaned.
In order to remove the coatings and inks from the aluminum, it is melted.
Ingots are formed from the melted aluminum once it has been formed into large formations.
Ingots are transported to another facility and rolled out so that they can be handled more easily.
At this point, the ingots can be turned into new aluminum products.
