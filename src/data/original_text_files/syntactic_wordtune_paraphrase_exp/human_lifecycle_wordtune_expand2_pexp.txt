There is a meeting between a sperm and an egg in the uterus of a female.
This is where the sperm implants itself into the egg.
As the sperm and egg adhere to the wall of the uterus, they form a zygote.
The fetus grows and develops inside the uterus.
Eventually, the woman gives birth to a baby.
As a baby grows, parents are responsible for raising it until it is able to take care of itself.
At that point, the person goes out into the world and finds work.
They meet other people and make a life for themselves.
Eventually, the person gets a career, gets married, and has children.
A few years later he or she retires and eventually passes away.
