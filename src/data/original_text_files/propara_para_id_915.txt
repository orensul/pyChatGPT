Sediment transport is the movement of solid particles (sediment).
The movement is due to a combination of gravity acting on the sediment, and/or the movement of the fluid in which the sediment is entrained.
Sediment transport occurs in natural systems where the particles are clastic rocks (sand, gravel, boulders, etc.), mud, or clay.
The fluid is air, water, or ice.
And the force of gravity acts to move the particles along the sloping surface on which they are resting.
Sediment transport due to fluid motion occurs in rivers, oceans, lakes, seas, and other bodies of water due to currents and tides.
Transport is also caused by glaciers as they flow.
