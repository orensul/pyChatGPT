There are places inside Earth where rock will melt.
Melted rock inside the Earth is also called molten rock, or magma.
Magma moves up through Earth's crust, but it does not always reach the surface.
When magma erupts onto Earth's surface, it is known as lava.
As lava flows from volcanoes it starts to cool.
Minerals form when magma and lava cool.
