Coal is loaded into the firebox.
The boiler produces steam under high pressure.
The steam generated in the boiler flows down into a cylinder.
Just ahead of the wheels, pushing a tight-fitting plunger, the piston.
The piston is connected to one or more of the locomotive's wheels through a kind of arm-elbow-shoulder joint called a crank and connecting rod.
As the piston pushes, the crank and connecting rod turn the locomotive's wheels and power the train along.
An outlet valve opens and the piston pushes the steam back through the cylinder and out up the locomotive's chimney.
