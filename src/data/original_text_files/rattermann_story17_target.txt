McGhee was a sailor who wanted a few days of vacation on land.
One day, the captain announced that he would be taking a vacation in the mountains.
However, he said, everyone else would have to remain on the ship.
After McGhee heard this he became so upset that he decided to get revenge.
Within an hour McGhee blew up the captain's cabin with dynamite.
