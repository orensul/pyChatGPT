Mr. Newton was the manager of a company that made razors.
One year, an inventor in his company perfected a metal that would stay sharper than any previous razor.
However, not long after that, Mr. Newton was using one of these new razors and he cut his neck rather severely.
As a result of this incident the inventor recommended a safety feature that would protect people from injuring themselves.
After what had happened, Mr. Newton considered the safety feature absolutely necessary.
The incident had alarmed him so much that he began to produce the safety razor right away.
Luckily, his neck did not get infected so everything was alright.
