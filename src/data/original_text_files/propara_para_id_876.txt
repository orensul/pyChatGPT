Water vapor gets into the atmosphere through a process called evaporation.
This then turns the water that is at the top of oceans, rivers and lakes into water vapor in the atmosphere using energy from the sun.
The water vapor rises in the atmosphere and there it cools down.
Water vapor rises in the atmosphere and there it cools down and forms tiny water droplets through something called condensation.
These then turn into clouds.
When they all combine together, they grow bigger and are too heavy to stay up there in the air.
This is when they will fall to the ground as rain, or maybe snow or hail by gravity.
