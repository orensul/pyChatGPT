Rain falls on wood.
The rain seeps into the wood surface.
It permeates the wood.
When rain evaporates it leaves the wood.
It takes the finish of the wood with it.
The wood begins to lose it's luster.
It begins to look bad.
It has pieces of paint missing from the rain.
It gets worse when it rains.
It eventually will have no paint left.
