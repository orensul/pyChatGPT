You must decide the purpose of the satellite.
You must draw up a plan to what kind of orbit the satellite will travel.
You make preparations for the rocket that will travel into space.
Prepare the crew that will send it there.
You begin the countdown date for the rocket.
And then you send the rocket carrying the satellite into space.
Once in orbit the satellite will be placed where it was planned.
