Chloroplasts in the leaf of the plant traps light from the sun.
The roots absorb water and minerals from the soil.
This combination of water and minerals flows from the stem into the leaf.
Carbon dioxide enters the leaf.
Light, water and minerals, and the carbon dioxide all mix together.
This mixture forms sugar (glucose) which is what the plant eats.
Oxygen goes out of the leaf through the stomata.
