You breathe in.
Air goes through all the little branches in your lungs to fill up the air sacs, or alveoli.
Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries.
The oxygen goes into the bloodstream.
Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up.
You breathe it out through your lungs.
