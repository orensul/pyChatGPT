The water evaporating from the surface of the earth reaches the atmosphere.
When water droplets condense into clouds, they form clouds.
As droplets blend together to create bigger drops, there will be a cloud.
When the drops combine they become heavier.
Gravity causes the drops to fall to the ground.
