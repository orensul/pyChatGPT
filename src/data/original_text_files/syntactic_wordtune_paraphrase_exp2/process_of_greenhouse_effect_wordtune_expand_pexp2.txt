During the day, solar radiation reaches the Earth's atmosphere.
A certain amount of that radiation is reflected back into space.
There is a remainder of energy that is suck up by the land and oceans, which heats the Earth.
When the heat of the Earth meets space, it radiates into space.
A portion of this heat is captured by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which catch the heat.
The burning of fossil fuels causes the greenhouse gases to be released into the atmosphere at a bigger rate.
These gases cause the amount of heat radiation in our atmosphere to rise.
As a result, the Earth's temperature climbs.
