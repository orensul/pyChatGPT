Aluminum cans and other products are recycled.
Recycling facilities or your town gather and carry aluminum.
At the central facility, the aluminum is ordered and cleaned.
The ink and coatings are eradicated.
It is then formed into ingots.
During transport, the ingots are rolled out for easier manipulation.
Now they could be turned into new aluminum products.
