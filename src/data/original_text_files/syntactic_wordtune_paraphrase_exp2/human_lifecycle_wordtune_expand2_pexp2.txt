There is a meeting between a sperm and an egg in the uterus of a female.
This is where the sperm embed itself into the egg.
As the sperm and egg stick to the wall of the uterus, they constitute a zygote.
The fetus grows and develops inside the uterus.
As a baby grows, parents are responsible for raising it until it is able to look after itself.
At that point, the person emerges into the world and finds work.
They encounter other people and make a life for themselves.
Eventually, the person acquires a career, gets married, and has children.
A few years later he or she retires and eventually died.
