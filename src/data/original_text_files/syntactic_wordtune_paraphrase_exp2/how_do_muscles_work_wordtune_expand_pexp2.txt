A brain signal travels through the nerves to the muscles by means of electrical impulses.
In the muscles, filaments are composed of two types of proteins.
Whenever the brain sends an instruction to the filaments, they move.
Muscles contract and shorten when filaments move within them due to the motion of the filaments.
It is necessary to have opposite pairs of muscles in order to be able to move within the necessary range.
