During the baking process, the bread is exposed to the elements.
Whenever it is exposed to air, it absorbs moisture.
The warmth of the air is absorbed by bread.
As a result, there is dust on the bread containing mold spores.
Once the mold spores reach the bread, they begin to eat the bread for energy.
After a while, mold colonies appear on the bread.
