Quiggly Company was as small company that manufactured electrical components.
One, year, Quiggly Co. began to get into the integrated circuit market.
However, Quiggly Company felt that to be competitive it would have to have really sophisticated space factories, as did all the other manufacturers of integrated circuits.
Thus, Quiggly put all its assets into having a space factory.
The company just didn't realize what a financial risk space manufacturing was.
As a result, within six months, Quiggly Company had spent much more than they could afford and their stocks plunged to an all time low.
Quiggly Co. decided to pull out of integrated circuits altogether and went back to making conventional electrical components.
