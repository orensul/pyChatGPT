Something makes a sound and makes sound waves.
Sound waves are "collected" by the the outer ear.
Sound waves travel through the middle ear.
Sound waves hit the eardrum.
Vibrations from the eardrum cause very small bones in the inner ear to move.
The small bones in the inner ear give information about sound to the cochlea.
The cochlea helps turn the sound vibrations into nerve signals.
The brain can take these nerve signals and can register a sound to you because of them.
