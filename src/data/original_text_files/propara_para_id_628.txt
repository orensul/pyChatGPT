Over 99% of the exocrine pancreas cells produce digestive juices.
They secrete digestive juice "externally" into the small intestine.
There are enzymes for breaking down fats, proteins , and carbohydrates.
Digestive juices flows from the pancreas through an excretory duct into the small intestine.
When the blood sugar levels rise, as they might after a meal, insulin is released.
When blood sugar levels are too low, the pancreas releases glucagon into the bloodstream.
