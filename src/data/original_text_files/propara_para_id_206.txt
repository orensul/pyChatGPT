Muscles work by expanding and contracting.
A muscle fiber gets a signal from its nerve.
Proteins and chemicals release energy to either contract the muscle or relax it.
When the muscles contracts the bones connected to he muscle are pulled closer together.
When the muscle relaxes the bones move farther apart.
