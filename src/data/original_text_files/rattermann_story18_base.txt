A cobra called Pierre was slithering through the brush when a falcon came towards it.
Pierre became frightened and struck, wounding the falcon in the abdomen.
To teach him a lesson, the falcon grabbed the cobra and flew away with it.
Unfortunately for both of them, after they were high above the earth the wounded falcon became too weak to fly.
Consequently, they plummeted straight down to the earth and perished.
They landed, strangely enough, in the middle of an outdoor wedding ceremony.
