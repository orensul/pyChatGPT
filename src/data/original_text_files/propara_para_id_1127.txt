Warm water floats up from the ocean.
A pocket of low pressure air is created near the surface of the ocean.
Warm air from outside areas pushes into the low pressure area.
The warm air keeps rising and forms clouds.
The wind is getting fed moisture that evaporates from the ocean.
This moisture causes the swirling air and clouds to grow bigger.
As it gets bigger the wind rotates faster.
