A large amount of water evaporates from the ground upwards into the sky.
When the water is evaporating from the ground, it forms droplets in the clouds.
The droplets combine to form bigger drops and then the clouds are filled with them.
As the drops get larger, they become heavier.
They fall toward the ground due to gravity.
