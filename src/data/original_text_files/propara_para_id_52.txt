Fault lines appear underground.
The fault lines grow over time.
The rocks on each side of the fault lines rub against the rocks on the other side of the fault line.
The rocks put pressure on each other.
The rocks break from the pressure.
The breaking of the rocks releases a lot of energy.
The energy causes seismic waves.
The seismic waves make the earth shake.
