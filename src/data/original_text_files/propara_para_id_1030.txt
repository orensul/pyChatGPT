Your thermostat senses that the room temperature has fallen below your thermostat setting.
Your thermostat sends a signal to your heating system to provide heat for your home.
When your oil burner is engaged, heating oil travels from the tank to the burner by way of a pump.
Here the oil becomes a fine mist mixed with air.
The fuel/air mixture is then injected into the burner where it is ignited in the combustion chamber.
The warm air is disbursed through vents, hot water through baseboards, or by steam radiators.
