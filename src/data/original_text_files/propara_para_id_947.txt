Rises into the Earth's atmosphere.
Condensation occurs when water vapor turns into tiny particles of water/ice.
And form together into clouds or fog.
Precipitation of rain/snow occurs when wind/temperatures change.
Fallen rain or snow collects into surface water which will evaporate into water vapor again.
