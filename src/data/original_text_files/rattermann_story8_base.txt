A dog named Leonard was trotting along a dock holding a steak in his teeth.
However, as he trotted he dropped it inadvertently and it disappeared into the lake.
Thus, he was left without his dinner.
Then Leonard saw another dog with a steak.
Because he had lost his own steak he tried to take it.
Unluckily, the other dog was much bigger than he was.
Leonard ended up losing a tooth in the scuffle.
