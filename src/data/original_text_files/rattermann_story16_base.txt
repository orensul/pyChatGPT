Two pioneers, Smith and Johnson, discovered a gorgeous little valley that was as yet unclaimed in Oregon Territory.
Each of them wanted the land for himself, so soon they were fighting over who saw it first.
While they were fighting over it, Sheriff Jones came along and divided the land evenly between them.
In the end, Smith and Johnson realized that they should have done that on their own.
From that day forward they were the best of friends, and they helped build each others' houses.
