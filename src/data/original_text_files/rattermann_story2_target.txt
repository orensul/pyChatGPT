Ms. Boyce was in charge of installing heat lamps sold by the Smith Tan Company.
In 1980, a supplier for the company perfected a filament that could produce more intense heat than any previous filament.
But later, when Ms. Boyce was using one of these new heat lamps herself she was seriously burned.
Because of this accident the supplier recommended a warning label that would protect people from hurting themselves with the new lamp.
After this, Ms. Boyce considered the labels absolutely necessary.
The accident frightened her so much that she had the labels printed immediately.
