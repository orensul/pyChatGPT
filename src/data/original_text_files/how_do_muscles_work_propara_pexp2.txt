Electrical signals in the brain travel through nerves to muscles.
Two types of proteins exist in filaments in the muscles.
The filaments move when the brain instructs them to.
The motion of the filaments cause the muscle to shorten and contract.
Opposing pairs of muscles exist in order to provide the necessary range of motion.
