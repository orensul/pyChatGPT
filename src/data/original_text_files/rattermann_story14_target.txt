Zebediah, the old miser, was sitting on his back porch counting his money.
Suddenly, a beggar came out of the forsythia bushes.
Zebediah was very frightened so he started yelling for the beggar to go away.
The yelling only caught the beggar's attention and he began walking towards the old man.
The miser wished he had left the beggar alone.
To escape, Zebediah threw a bag of coins to the beggar.
While the beggar was occupied, Zebediah took the last few bags of money into the house and locked the door.
Zebediah figured that he was safe inside and he dozed off in an easy chair.
When he awoke he was surprised to discover another bag of coins was missing.
He could not find it anywhere!
