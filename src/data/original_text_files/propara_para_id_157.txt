You place aluminum cans and other products into recycling bins.
Your town or a private company collect and transport the aluminum to a recycling facility.
The aluminum is sorted and cleaned at the central recycling facility.
The aluminum is melted down to remove coatings and inks.
The melted aluminum is formed into large formations called ingots.
The ingots are transported to another facility and rolled out to make them easier to manipulate.
The ingots can now be turned into new aluminum products.
