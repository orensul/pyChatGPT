Once there was a teacher named Mrs. Jackson who wanted a salary increase.
One day, the principal said that he was increasing his own salary by 20 percent.
However, he said, there was not enough money to give the teachers a salary increase.
When Mrs. Jackson heard this she became so angry that she decided to take revenge.
The next day, Mrs. Jackson used gasoline to set fire to the principal's office.
Then she went to a bar and got drunk.
