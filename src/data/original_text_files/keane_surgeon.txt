A surgeon was trying to destroy a cancer which was situated in the central region of a patient's brain, by using a type of ray.
He needed to use these rays at a high intensity in order to destroy the cancerous tissue.
However, at such an intensity the healthy brain tissue will also be destroyed.
After considerable thought, he knew just what to do.
He divided the rays up into batches of low-intensity rays, and then by sending them, simultaneously from a number of different directions, they converged on the cancer, making up a sufficiently high intensity to destroy it.
