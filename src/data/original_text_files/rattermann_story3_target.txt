Alexander was a man who lived with his wife in his house a long time ago.
He liked to boast to a friend that with his wife at home he would always eat well.
One day, when he was very hungry, Alexander went home to his wife.
But she thought Alexander would be eating someplace else so she had only prepared enough for herself and their baby.
Thus Alexander went without dinner.
But to make sure he would not go hungry again, Alexander married a second wife.
