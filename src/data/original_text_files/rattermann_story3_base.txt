Joseph was a millionaire who hired a chauffeur to drive his Rolls-Royce.
He used to brag. to his wife that he would never be late for his conferences since he had hired a chauffeur.
One morning when he was in a great hurry, he went to find the chauffeur.
But he was asleep.
He thought his services would not be needed that day.
Thus Joseph was very late for his conference after all.
To make sure this would not happen again, Joseph hired a second chauffeur.
This turned out to be very expensive because the second chauffeur wanted a fancy uniform as well as a high salary.
