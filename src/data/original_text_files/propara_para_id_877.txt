Warm air from the surface rises into the higher cold air.
The water vapor in the air is condensed.
The condensed water and dust forms a cloud.
Wind in the cloud bounces the water droplets around.
The bouncing droplets join together.
The bigger droplets get heavy.
The heavy droplets fall.
As they fall, they join with more moisture in the air.
The droplets get larger.
Rain falls.
