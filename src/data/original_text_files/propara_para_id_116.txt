Movements of tectonic plates causes the creation of volcanoes.
These volcanoes erupt.
Volcanic mountains are formed from the eruption.
Sometimes tectonic plates crash into one another or ride over one another.
These plates sometimes fold and buckle, which forms Fold Mountains.
Sometimes fault blocks are raised or tilted, and they form Block Mountains.
