Sunlight hits chloroplasts in the plant.
The energy from the sunlight causes an enzyme in the plant to break apart the water.
The water breakes into oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons.
Hydrogen, along with electrons energized by light, converts NADP into NADPH.
Oxygen diffuses out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis.
