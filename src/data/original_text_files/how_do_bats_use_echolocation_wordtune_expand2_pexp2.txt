In one part of the city, there are a lot of bats flying around.
Using the mouth or the nose of the bat, they emit sounds.
These sound waves go away from the bat as they fly.
The sound waves beat objects in the environment.
After beating the objects, the sound waves bounce back towards the bat.
The bat hears the sound waves bouncing off the objects back towards the bat.
The bat is aware of the objects' location because of where the sound echoed from.
By hitting the objects, the bat does not hurt itself.
