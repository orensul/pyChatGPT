A general was trying to destroy a fortress which was situated at the center of a country with roads leading to it, by using his army.
He needed to use his army as a complete group in order to destroy the fortress.
However, he could not march his army down a road to the fortress because the roads were mined to explode when large groups of men passed over them.
After considerable thought, he knew just what to do.
He divided his army up into small groups of men, and by sending these groups, simultaneously, from a number of different directions, they converged on the fortress, making up a sufficiently powerful army to destroy it.
