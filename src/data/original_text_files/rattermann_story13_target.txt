Cornelius was an astronomer who thought about nothing but astronomy.
He was obsessed with stars and galaxies.
Gradually he was turning his home into an observatory.
But before he was finished his wife Agatha complained that he was spending too much time renovating the house and not enough on his job which was astronomy.
As a result, the house was no longer livable. Cornelius decided that Agatha was right and he went back to thinking about nothing but astronomy.
Then, one evening when Cornelius was walking through his house, an unfinished floor collapsed under his weight.
Cornelius was severely injured but the accident showed him that he should try to balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.
