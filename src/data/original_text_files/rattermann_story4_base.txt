Karla, an old hawk, lived at the top of a tall oak tree.
One afternoon, she saw a hunter on the ground with a bow and some crude arrows that had no feathers.
The hunter took aim and shot at the hawk but missed.
Karla knew the hunter wanted her feathers so she glided down to the hunter and offered to give him a few.
The hunter was so grateful that he pledged never to shoot at a hawk again.
He went off and shot deer instead.
