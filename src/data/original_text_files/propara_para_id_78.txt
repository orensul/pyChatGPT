Wind and water erode rocks.
The wind and water pick up sediment that came off the rocks.
Sediment is carried to an area by the wind, water, air, or ice.
Sediment is deposited on the same spot many times.
The sediment piles on top of other sediment for a long time.
The sediment near the bottom is compressed by the weight of newer sediment.
The sediment becomes sedimentary rock as it is pushed together by the heavy weight.
