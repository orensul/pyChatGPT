Bees go out during the day and gather food.
Then while gathering of their food, they make wax, which is the building block of their bee hive.
Bees make food called honey.
They use a sticky, glue-like substance called propolis as a binding to hold their hives together.
Bees produce all of the building blocks to build their hive in their own body.
