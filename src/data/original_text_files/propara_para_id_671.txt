A liquid is heated from an external source.
The heat causes the molecules in the liquid to increase in energy.
As the molecules absorb more energy, they start to move faster.
As the molecules are moving faster they are increasing in temperature.
When the molecules reach a certain temperature, the boiling point, they change from liquid to gas state.
As the liquid molecules go into a gaseous state, they float out into the atmosphere.
When all the liquid has turned to gas, it has evaporated completely, leaving no liquid behind.
