A group of bats fly through an area.
Bats make sounds by using their mouths or noses to do sounds.
As the sound waves travel away from the bat, they are absorbed by the earth.
Sound waves strike objects as they travel through the air.
In order for the sound waves to reach the bat, they need to rebound the objects.
As the sound waves reflect off of the objects, the bat hears them reverberating back to him.
The bat is able to determine where the objects are because it is able to hear the sound reverberates from where they are located.
As the bat beats the objects, it does not cause any injury to itself.
