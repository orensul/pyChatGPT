Owls hunt around their hunting territory away from where they roost during the day.
They sit still on a perch, like a stump of branch, and wait for prey.
They use their highly sensitive hearing to locate prey that cannot be seen.
They use their very keen vision to see prey in the dark.
They fly silently, without flapping their wings, in order to surprise the prey.
The owl silently glides or drops on its prey, grabbing it with its talons and beak.
The owl eats the prey, or carries it back to its perch.
