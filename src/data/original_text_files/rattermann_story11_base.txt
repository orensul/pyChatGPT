A farmer named Beedle had a choice apricot tree that he valued above all the rest in his garden.
Every year Beedle gave presents of fruit from this tree to everyone he knew.
But one year the tree began to wither and there was no moreof the wonderful fruit.
Everyone was very unhappy.
The judge had enjoyed the apricots from the tree very much so much so that he resolved to take the tree to his own garden to take care of it.
He paid Beedle very well and had the tree moved to his own grounds.
Fortunately, as soon as it was transplanted, the tree bore delicious apricots again.
That very year, the fruit won first prize in the county fair.
