Water from the ocean washes onto beaches in waves.
The waves contain sediment from the ocean.
The water and particles in it hit rocks and sand on the beach.
The wind and current sometimes push the water and particles harder.
Tiny parts of the rocks on the shore come off the larger rocks.
The waves pick up sand and small rocks from the beach.
The waves go back out into the ocean.
The waves carry the new particles with them.
Rocks and the beach look a little different.
