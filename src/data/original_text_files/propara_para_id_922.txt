Magma is formed when rock melts inside the Earth's crust.
Magma rises.
Collects inside magma chambers underneath a volcano.
Pressure builds in the magma chambers as they fill.
Gain energy for eruption.
Some of the energy is converted into seismic activity (earthquakes).
If the magma building in the volcano is thick and sticky it will trap gases.
Results in an explosive eruption when the pressure becomes too intense.
If the magma is thin and runs.
The magma results in a low-pressure, slow-moving flow of magma instead of a violent eruption.
