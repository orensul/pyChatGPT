William was a patient in a psychiatric hospital who was confined indoors almost all the time.
He could never pass the monthly room inspections so he hated them.
He spent most of his time daydreaming about food.
A few day before the April inspection William's room was still a mess since he had done nothing but daydream.
To provide William with an incentive, the nurse promised him some gingerbread from the cookie shop if he scrubbed his room and put it in order once and for all.
William was overjoyed.
But there was no longer enough time for him to put it in order.
As a result, he did not pass the inspection and did not get any gingerbread.
William sulked all day and slammed his door so hard the plaster cracked, but he still didn't get any gingerbread.
