Tectonic plates beneath the earth rub against each other.
The rocks around the cracks crumble.
An earth quake happens.
The force of the earthquake is large.
Rocks are pushed up out of the earth by the force.
These rocks become volcanos.
The volcanos erupt many times.
The size of the rocky area grows.
The volcano becomes dormant.
The volcano and its eruptions become a mountain.
