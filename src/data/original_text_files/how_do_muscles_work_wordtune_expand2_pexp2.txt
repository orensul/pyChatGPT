In order for electrical signals to reach muscles, they have to travel through nerves in the brain.
There are two kinds of proteins that make up filaments within the muscles.
In order for the filaments to move, the brain must instruct the filaments to do so.
A contraction in the muscle occurs as a result of the filaments contracting and shortening.
As opposed to one pair of muscles, there are two opposing pairs in order to provide the necessary range of movement.
